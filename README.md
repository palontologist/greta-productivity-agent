# üöÄ Greta Productivity Agent

> **Mission-aligned productivity tracking that helps you work on what truly matters.**

Greta Productivity Agent is an Electron-based desktop companion that bridges the gap between passive activity monitoring and intentional, mission-driven work. Unlike traditional time trackers that just count minutes, Greta helps you understand *how well* your daily activities align with your personal mission and long-term goals.

## üéØ The Vision

We're building a productivity agent that:

- **Tracks with purpose**: Monitors your screen and app usage, but filters everything through the lens of your mission alignment
- **Learns passively, guides actively**: Understands your work patterns without interruption, then provides timely, actionable nudges
- **Syncs seamlessly**: Integrates with the [Greta dashboard](https://greta-v2.vercel.app/dashboard) via API for unified insights
- **Respects privacy**: All tracking happens locally first, with full control over what gets synced
- **Empowers reflection**: Combines automatic logging with manual journaling for deeper self-awareness

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üìä Structured Screen & App Tracking

- **Window title monitoring**: Captures active application and document/tab titles
- **Idle detection**: Distinguishes between active work and away-from-keyboard time
- **Category classification**: Automatically tags activities (Deep Work, Communication, Research, Distraction, etc.)
- **Smart batching**: Groups similar activities into meaningful work blocks

### üîÑ Passive & Active Logging

**Passive Layer:**
- Background monitoring with minimal resource footprint
- Activity snapshots every 5-30 seconds (configurable)
- Smart detection of context switches and multitasking patterns

**Active Layer:**
- Quick manual log entries for offline work, meetings, or creative sessions
- Voice-to-text reflection capture (optional)
- Mission alignment self-rating for completed work blocks
- Quick task annotations ("What was this for?")

### üåê API Sync & Dashboard Integration

- Real-time or batched sync to Greta cloud dashboard
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for offline-first architecture
- Webhook support for third-party integrations (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV) for data portability

### üîí Privacy-First Design

- **Local-first**: All raw data stored encrypted on your machine
- **Selective sync**: Choose which data categories to upload
- **Redaction tools**: Automatically filter sensitive window titles or URLs
- **Data retention policies**: Configurable auto-deletion of granular logs
- **No keystroke logging**: We track *what* you work on, not *how* you type it

## üìà Dashboard Metrics & Sections

Inspired by ActivityWatch and FrontForumFocus, but reimagined for mission-driven productivity:

### 1. üéØ Mission Alignment Score

**What it shows:**
- Daily/weekly/monthly alignment percentage
- Color-coded breakdown of time spent on mission-critical vs. off-mission activities
- Trend line showing improvement over time

**Why it matters:**
Knowing you spent 8 hours "working" isn't enough. Did those hours move you toward your goals?

### 2. üß† Deep Work Blocks

**What it shows:**
- Number and duration of uninterrupted focus sessions
- Peak performance time of day
- Deep work quality score (based on context switches, app diversity, idle time)
- "Personal best" tracking and streaks

**Why it matters:**
Deep work is where real progress happens. This metric helps you protect and expand your focus time.

### 3. üåÄ Distraction Trends

**What it shows:**
- Most common distraction sources (apps, websites, times of day)
- Distraction frequency heat map
- Average time to return to focused work after interruption
- Week-over-week distraction reduction

**Why it matters:**
You can't fix what you don't measure. Identify your kryptonite and build defenses.

### 4. üìù Reflection Journal

**What it shows:**
- Timeline of manual journal entries paired with activity data
- Sentiment analysis of reflections
- Correlation between subjective experience and objective metrics
- Searchable archive with tags and filters

**Why it matters:**
Numbers tell part of the story. Your lived experience completes it.

### 5. üí° Actionable Nudges

**What it shows:**
- Real-time suggestions based on current behavior patterns
- "You've been in shallow work for 2 hours‚Äîready for deep work?"
- "This week's lowest-alignment time block was Wednesday afternoon. What happened?"
- Personalized recommendations for schedule optimization

**Why it matters:**
Insights are only valuable if they drive action. Nudges close the loop.

### 6. ‚úçÔ∏è Manual Log Entry

**What it shows:**
- Quick-add interface for logging offline activities
- Pre-filled templates for common tasks (meetings, commute, exercise, learning)
- Retroactive editing of auto-logged blocks
- Integration with calendar imports

**Why it matters:**
Your productivity doesn't stop when you're away from your computer. Capture the full picture.

### 7. üë• Team Comparison (Optional)

**What it shows:**
- Anonymous, aggregate benchmarks from opt-in Greta community
- Percentile ranking for deep work hours, alignment score, distraction resistance
- Team leaderboards for accountability groups

**Why it matters:**
Healthy competition and social accountability can supercharge your progress.

### 8. üìä Visual Analytics

**What it shows:**
- Interactive timelines and heatmaps
- Sunburst charts for activity breakdown
- Sankey diagrams for attention flow
- Customizable dashboard widgets
- Export-ready charts for presentations or reports

**Why it matters:**
Beautiful visualizations make patterns obvious and sharing your progress effortless.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Electron + React + TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Local Storage**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **API Client**: Axios with retry logic and offline queue
- **System APIs**: 
  - macOS: Accessibility API + CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo
  - Windows: Win32 API (GetForegroundWindow)
  - Linux: X11/Wayland session info

### Data Flow

```
[System APIs] ‚Üí [Activity Collector] ‚Üí [Local SQLite] ‚Üí [Sync Engine] ‚Üí [Greta API]
                                            ‚Üì
                                    [Local Dashboard]
                                            ‚Üì
                                  [Electron App UI]
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Offline-first**: Agent works fully without internet connection
2. **Minimal performance impact**: <1% CPU, <100MB RAM typical usage
3. **Respectful notifications**: Nudges are helpful, never nagging
4. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom trackers and integrations
